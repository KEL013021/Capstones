1. The app works as expected: it detects the user's location via IP, allows address search using OpenStreetMap, and calculates distance between user and destination.
2. The UI is clean, simple, and easy to understand.
3. Coordinates and distance calculations are accurate and well-presented.
4. Minor Suggestion: Adding map drag and zoom functionality to improve interactivity. Currently, the map image is static and not interactive.
